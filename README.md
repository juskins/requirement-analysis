# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
This repositry is a Requirement Analysis project that focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.
# What is Requirement Analysis?
## 📘 Overview

**Requirement Analysis** is the **first and one of the most crucial phases** of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It involves **gathering, understanding, and documenting** what a system is supposed to achieve — both from a **functional** and **non-functional** perspective.

The goal is to ensure **clarity, completeness, and alignment** between what stakeholders expect and what developers deliver.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of Requirement Analysis

1. **Identify Stakeholder Needs:**  
   Understand who the users are and what problems they are trying to solve.

2. **Define System Requirements:**  
   Translate user needs into clear, actionable technical requirements.

3. **Establish Scope:**  
   Clearly define what is included in (and excluded from) the system to prevent scope creep.

4. **Create a Foundation for Design & Development:**  
   Provide developers and designers with a roadmap that aligns with business objectives.

## 🧠 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

| Phase | Dependency on Requirement Analysis |
|-------|------------------------------------|
| **Planning** | Determines project feasibility, cost, and timeline. |
| **Design** | Architecture and UI decisions depend on accurate requirements. |
| **Development** | Guides developers on what to build and how it should behave. |
| **Testing** | Test cases are derived directly from the requirements. |
| **Deployment & Maintenance** | Ensures updates and fixes align with the intended goals. |

A **poorly conducted requirement analysis** often leads to:
- Miscommunication among stakeholders  
- Cost overruns and schedule delays  
- Rework and technical debt  
- Low user satisfaction or system failure

## 🧩 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

1. **Requirement Gathering:**  
   Collect raw information from stakeholders, end-users, and subject matter experts through:
   - Interviews  
   - Surveys  
   - Observation  
   - Document analysis  

2. **Requirement Elicitation:**  
   Engage with users to extract and clarify their needs, even the ones not explicitly stated.

3. **Requirement Documentation:**  
   Document requirements clearly and precisely using:
   - Software Requirement Specification (SRS)  
   - Use Cases  
   - User Stories
  
4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
   Prioritizig requirements based on importance and impact, analyzing the feasibility, and creating models (e.g data flow diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

4. **Requirement Validation:**  
   Review and confirm that documented requirements accurately reflect user needs and are feasible within constraints.

5. **Requirement Management:**  
   Continuously monitor and update requirements as the project evolves.

## 📄 Types of Requirement

In software engineering, requirements are generally classified into two broad categories: **Functional Requirements** and **Non-Functional Requirements**.  
This section provides clear definitions and examples for each, tailored to the **Booking Management System** (inspired by Airbnb/OYO’s system architecture).

---

### ⚙️ Functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Functional requirements describe *what the system should do*. They define the specific behaviors, actions, and features that enable users to interact with the application.

**Examples (for the Booking Management Project):**
- The system shall allow users to **search for properties** by location, date range, number of guests, and filters such as price or amenities.
- The system shall allow users to **view detailed property information**, including images, host details, availability calendar, pricing, reviews, and booking options.
- The system shall allow users to **create and confirm bookings**, select dates, enter payment details, and receive a confirmation receipt.
- The system shall allow **hosts to list new properties**, upload images, define availability, and set pricing and rules.
- The system shall provide **real-time availability checks** using cached data (e.g., Redis) before confirming bookings.
- The system shall allow **user authentication and authorization**, supporting roles like Guest, Host, and Admin.
- The system shall generate **notifications** for booking confirmations, cancellations, or changes.
- The system shall allow **admins to monitor bookings and resolve disputes**.

---

### ⚡ Non-Functional Requirements

**Definition:**  
Non-functional requirements define *how well* the system performs. They refer to system qualities such as performance, scalability, reliability, and security rather than specific features.

**Examples (for the Booking Management Project):**

#### 🧠 Performance
- Search results should load within **2 seconds** for 95% of user requests under normal load.
- Cached queries (via Redis) for “recent booking history” should respond within **500 milliseconds**.

#### ☁️ Scalability
- The system should handle **1,000 concurrent booking requests** without service degradation.
- The architecture should support **horizontal scaling** through microservices and distributed databases.

#### 🔐 Security
- All payment transactions must use **HTTPS** and comply with **PCI DSS** standards.
- Passwords must be **hashed and salted** using secure algorithms such as bcrypt.
- Sensitive user data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

#### ⚙️ Reliability & Availability
- The system must achieve **99.9% uptime** during peak hours.
- Each booking transaction must follow **ACID principles**, ensuring complete or rollback behavior.

#### 🧩 Maintainability & Extensibility
- The system should adopt a **microservices architecture** to allow independent service updates and feature additions.
- Source code should follow **modular, well-documented** structure to simplify maintenance.

#### ♿ Usability & Accessibility
- The user interface (UI) must comply with **WCAG 2.1 AA** accessibility standards.
- The design should ensure a seamless experience on **mobile, tablet, and desktop devices**.

## 🧰 Techniques & Tools

| Technique | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Interviews** | Direct discussions with stakeholders to capture expectations. |
| **Brainstorming** | Collaborative idea generation for potential features. |
| **Use Case Modeling** | Describes interactions between users and the system. |
| **Prototyping** | Visual models or mockups to clarify ambiguous requirements. |
| **Document Analysis** | Review existing materials or processes to extract needs. |

**Common Tools:**  
- JIRA / Trello — for tracking requirements  
- Lucidchart / Draw.io — for diagrams and flowcharts  
- Figma / Miro — for UI mockups  
- Google Docs / Confluence — for documentation and collaboration

## 🧮 Example: Requirement Analysis in Practice

**Scenario:** Building a “Contact Us” form on a website

| Step | Outcome |
|------|----------|
| *Requirement Gathering* | “Users want to reach support via an online form.” |
| *Specification* | The form should have Name, Email, Subject, and Message fields. |
| *Validation* | Stakeholders confirm the fields cover all contact needs. |
| *Management* | Add CAPTCHA requirement later to reduce spam. |

---

## 🧭 Best Practices

- Involve all key stakeholders early.  
- Avoid ambiguous terms like “user-friendly” — define measurable criteria.  
- Prioritize requirements (e.g., *Must Have*, *Should Have*, *Could Have*).  
- Maintain a **traceability matrix** to link requirements with design, code, and tests.  
- Review frequently as business goals evolve.

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

Requirement Analysis forms the **foundation of successful software development**.  
A well-executed analysis ensures that the final product:
- Meets business and user expectations,  
- Minimizes rework and costs, and  
- Delivers genuine value.  

> “A system built on unclear requirements is like a house built on sand — it might stand for a while, but it will eventually collapse.”
